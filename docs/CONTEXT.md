# Context Notes

The project began with manual VPS setup:
- PostgreSQL with user `domenai`, password `larakniaukialiauliauliau`
- Root SSH access verified
- Working directory `/srv/domenai`

We plan to:
- Build a Python-based backend for domain data
- Store domain info in PostgreSQL
- Later expose an API and possibly a small UI
- Move development to VS Code with Copilot support

Current focus: finish environment setup â†’ create `main.py` with DB connection test.
